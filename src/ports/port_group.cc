/*
**
**  DESCRIPTION
**    Adds a RULE_NODE to a PortGroup.  This particular
**    function is specific in that it adds "no content" rules.
**    A "no content" rule is a snort rule that has no "content"
**    or "uri" flag, and hence does not need to be pattern
**    matched.
**
**    Each RULE_NODE in a PortGroup is given a RULE_NODE
**    ID.  This allows us to track particulars as to what
**    rules have been alerted upon, and allows other neat
**    things like correlating events on different streams.
**    The RULE_NODE IDs may not be consecutive, because
**    we can add RULE_NODES into "content", "uri", and
**    "no content" lists.
**
**  FORMAL INPUTS
**    PortGroup* - PortGroup to add the rule to.
**    void* - ptr to the user information
**
**  FORMAL OUTPUT
**    int - 0 is successful, 1 is failure
**
