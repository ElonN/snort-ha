The features listed below must be explicitly enabled so they are built
into the Snort binary.  For a full list of build features, run ./configure
--help.

*  *--enable-ppm*: enable packet and rule performance monitoring and coarse
   latency enforcement.

*  *--enable-perf-profiling*: enable module and rule performance profiling.

*  *--enable-shell*: enable local and remote command line shell support.

These features are built only if the required libraries and headers are
present.  There is no need to explicitly enable.

* *lzma*: from http://www.7-zip.org/sdk.html for decompression of SWF fles.

* *openssl*: from https://www.openssl.org for SHA and MD5 file signatures and
  the protected_content rule option.

* *intel-soft-cpm": an optional pattern matcher based on a library from
  Intel.

If you need to use headers and/or libraries in non-standard locations, you
can use these options:

* *--with-pkg-includes*: specify the directory containing the package
  headers.

* *--with-pkg-libraries*: specify the directory containing the package
  libraries.

These can be use for pcap, luajit, pcre, dnet, daq, lzma, openssl, and
intel-soft-cpm packages.
