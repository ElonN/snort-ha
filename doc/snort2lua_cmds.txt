==== Required option:

* 	A Snort configuration file to convert. Set with either '-c' or '--conf-file'


==== Default values:
* 	<out_file>   =  snort.lua
* 	<rule_file>  =  <out_file> = snort.lua.  Rules are written to the 'local_rules' variable in the <out_file>
* 	<error_file> =  snort.rej.  This file will not be created in quiet mode.
