==== Build

* configure will use clang++ by default if it is installed. 
To compile with g++ instead:

      export CXX=g++

* clang coughs up these warnings:

    Wunused-but-set-variable is not understood by clang
    clang: warning: argument unused during compilation: '-pthread'

* With cmake, make install will rebuild the docs even though when already
  built.

* IPS option hash and inspectors pop, imap, smtp, and ssl fail to build
  dynamically due to missing symbols in hash/ and protocols/ despite them
  being declared SO_PUBLIC.

* Enabling large pcap may erroneously affect the number of packets processed
  from pcaps

* Enabling debug messages may erroneously affect the number of packets
  processed from pcaps

==== Config

* Parsing issue with IP lists.  can't parse rules with $EXTERNAL_NET
defined as below because or the space between ! and 10.

    HOME_NET = [[ 10.0.17.0/24 10.0.14.0/24 10.247.0.0/16 10.246.0.0/16 ]]
    EXTERNAL_NET = '! ' .. HOME_NET

* Multiple versions of luajit scripts are not handled correctly.  The
first loaded version will always be executed even though plugin manager
saves the correct version.

* When using -c and -L together, the last on the command line wins (-c -L
  will dump; -L -c will analyze).

* Modules instantiated by command line only will not get default settings
  unless hard-coded.  This notably applies to -A and -L options.


==== Rules

* metdata:service foo; metadata:service foo; won't cause a duplicate service
warning as does metadata:service foo, service foo;

* ip_proto doesn't work properly with reassembled packets so it can't be
used to restrict the protocol of service rules.


==== Rules

* Inspector events generated while parsing TCP payload in non-IPS mode will
  indicate the wrong direction (ie they will be based on the ACK packet).
  (Same is true for Snort.)


==== snort2lua

* uricontent:"foo"; content:"bar"; -> http_uri; content:"foo"; content:"bar";
(missing pkt_data)

* stream_tcp ports and protocols both go into a single binder.when; this is
incorrect as the when fields are logically anded together (ie must all be
true).  should create 2 separate bindings.

* There is a bug in pps_stream_tcp.cc.. when stream_tcp: is
specified without any arguments, snort2lua doesn't convert it

* Loses the ip list delimiters [ ]; change to ( )

    in snort.conf: var HOME_NET [A,B,C]
    in snort.lua: HOME_NET = [[A B C]]

* Won't convert packet rules (alert tcp etc.) to service rules (alert http
etc.).
